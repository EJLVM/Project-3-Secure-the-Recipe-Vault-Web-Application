# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Creating VPC private endpoints for the S3 buckets would not prevent unauthorized access to the secret bucket as far as the IAM permissions for the S3 buckets are still insecure.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, enabling default encryption doesn't change the encryption of objects that are already in the S3 bucket. After you enable default encryption, the encryption that you set applies only to future uploads. 

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
